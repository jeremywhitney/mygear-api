myGear Database

This is the database for my Client-Side capstone project for NSS. 

Data is pulled from:
  - My own collection
  - Crowd-sourced submissions I received from a Google Form I made (friends, other NSS students, people from my social media accounts)
  - Fictional characters (ex. Wayne Campbell (Wayne's World), Marty McFly (Back to the Future)
  - Famous artists/musicians whose gear I researched and entered on my own
